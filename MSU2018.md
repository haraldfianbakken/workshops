# Case study

The Imperial digital recruitement agency is looking for new ways of innovating, reaching new customers and marketing their products and getting fans of the Empire. They have decided that they will try to create a new interactive platform for engaging with more customers. Their CMO has decided that their first project will be an interactive platform - set up as a competition where users stream (or upload) pictures of themselves with various products. 

The CIO sees the potential in this - and would also like to analyze all the data that is being generated, so they can better understand their customers and potentially find new ways of generating revenue and finding new potential recruits for the Academy. 

The Imperial Agency realizes the importance of social media - and would like to leverage existing platforms for authenticating and authorizing users - hoping that they can on long term gather data from these platforms as well.

Time to market is a crucial component in their strategy and empowering their customers into the feedback loop and product lifecycle is vital. For this reason - Dorth Avader the Chief of Engineer has decided that they will be heavily invested in DevOps.   

# Reqirements
 - There will be a landing page where unauthorized users can read about the competition and see the leaderboard. 
 - When a customer wants to join the competition - he/she needs to signup and login with Facebook.
 - A user can only vote on a picture when he/she is logged in with Facebook (or a social media provider)
 - Internal users for the Imperial Digital Agency will be using their own corporate credentials for signing in.
 -  The internal users have access to additional insights and data around the competiton and statistics.
 -  An internal user can create a new competition that are exposed public. Only one competition can be live at a given time. 
 - A competition has a start date and a end-date. A competition must contain a product - this is the product that the users will be helping "marketing".
 - Once a competition starts - it should inform its users that it's "ON" - by email (and preferrably posting on a Facebook page).
 - The competition is as following ; every morning and evening a user will be upload 2 photos of themselves - first one without the product , then one with the product in it. These images will be analyzed to try to answer the following statistical question - does the product make people more or less happy? Are there a difference between men and women? what about age? The pictures will be "tagged" with the strongest emotion and they will be publicly voting for who has the best "photo" this day in each genre. E.g. Sadest "chocolatebar" photo  or "Most neutral" x of the day. The winner (by public vote) goes on the scoreboard and will be displayed. It's important to log the votes for who is voting and it's a requirement that they must be logged in with the social media provider to vote. Only one vote per day. 
 - A competition has a prize for whomever wins. Also - if there's a "even" - it should be drawn randomly who will win. 
 - The CIO would also like to know where the users are sharing and how people are voting (e.g. are they mostly shared on facebook? Are most of their fanbase in Norway?)
 - An internal user should be able to delete a image (e.g. inappropriate image) that has been posted by a user
 - An internal user should be able to get statistics showing the demography of it's users (e.g. age, gender, location)
 - External users should be able to share a post so other users can "vote" for them
 - External users should see the 10 last submitted posts and what they're tagged with (on e.g. a landing page / or summary page).
 - External users should be able to browse the archive of competitions and see the pictures 
 - External users should be able to see and vote for a picture - but only one vote per day.
 - External users should be able to see the categories and browse the participants in each category , and see what position they are in.
 - On long term - the Imperial Agency will have a dedicated mobile app - so it's important that functionality can be re-used. 
 - The website should be optimized for both web and mobile - scaling down pictures to a mobile friendly version.
 - Every night after the daily voting ends (11 PM) - the users should get a summary email showing who is the winner in every category and remind them to log on tomorrow.
 - DevOps is the king - Dorth Avader requires agility and continous delivery. He would like the system automatically deployed into staging so a selection of users can be testing the new features that are coming fast. When a new version is ready for production - there should be a way to do this with no downtime for the uers. Also - continous improvement on the code base and quality is a must - ensuring code that is being built is always of better quality.
  - The CTO would like to know something about the usage of the application and the demography of where the application is being accessed from.
  

# Steps 
 - Read the case study
 - Write down the user stories you can think of from the requirements and case study. 
 - Discuss in your group - how will you be solving this? What frameworks ? What technology ? Draw a simple architecture of the solution 
 - Where do you store the data? How do you store the data? How do you aggregate the data? 
 - What should you store of each user?
 - How will you run the application(s)? 
 - Break down tasks (if/when you see it fit) and decide on team roles 
 - Start working - complete as much as you can in the short time frame! Work smart and divide the tasks as a team! 
 - 20 minutes before end - present solution to another group - and switch roles.
